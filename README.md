# TerraNova 
TerraNova is a machine-learning application designed to assist city planners in identifying and classifying brownfield sites. Brownfield sites are previously developed lands that may be contaminated or underutilized, making them potential candidates for redevelopment. This application uses a neural network to classify sites based on various features, helping city planners make informed land use and redevelopment decisions.
